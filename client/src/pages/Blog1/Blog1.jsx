            <h2 className={css.header}>Pseudonym (part 1)</h2>
            <p className={css.date}>1.7.23</p>
            <p>I understand why some of the greatest writers used a pseudonym.</p>
            <p>They did not publish work under their legal names. But rather they used pen names instead.</p>
            <p>I’ve thought to myself… How can a writer conceal their identity in today’s age? </p>
            <p>Back in the 1800s there was no social media. Ya know?</p>
            <p>Back then… A writer could supplant their birth name with an author name, and be able to compose
                work about whatever they wished to.</p>
            <p>They could be daring back then. They could push social boundaries in their work. By challenging
                conventional ways of thinking. Contesting cultural norms.</p>
            <p>They simply needed to be creative and talented.</p>
            <p>This is not to assert that we must reflect to the Victorian era as a beacon of literature. It’s only one
                reference point.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t about having a brand back then</p>
            <p>It was about commitment and dedication to the craft. This allowed writers to challenge socially
                accepted beliefs through narrative</p>
            <p>They understood that readers would take it “personally,” especially if the work was written with
                conviction. For this reason, using a pseudonym shielded their identity</p>
            <p>… Fortunately, and unfortunately, in modern times everyone has a pseudonym…</p>
            <p>A user-name. A profile name</p>
            <p>Where users, I mean people can publicly comment anonymously… recklessly, or poetically.</p>
            <p>Where users can make, *I mean influence others to feel good inside...</p>
            <p>Or, to despise themselves. Because there is zero in-between. There’s no gray area</p>
            <p>None-nuance. If you brand yourself well enough, you too can become publicly recognized as “that.”</p>
            <p>Whatever that may be.</p>
            <strong className={css.strong}>So long as there’s a demand for it.</strong>
            <p>As I ponder, how I can conceal my identity as a writer in 2023; in this modern age.</p>
            <p>When everything in life revolves around a “brand” … Shoot, if you work professionally, then that’s
                your brand.</p>
            <p>Hell, if you don’t work professionally, that’s also your brand.</p>
            <p>I am creative. I developed certain aspects of my craft within a classroom, where I was mandated to
                learn the history of my discipline. Learn about individuals that composed their literature with
                feathers and ink; a quill.</p>
            <p>Which is not to infer that one cannot master their craft independently. But how skilled can one be
                for example, at basketball if they only practice shooting in their driveway? It doesn’t matter how
                many hours they’ve put in… Sooner or later, they’re going to have to play against other talented
                players, and see where their skills rank. Now, we’ve got pro athletes working with trainers who never
                played on their level. Perhaps, those trainers need to get creative with the workouts, right? Then,
                professionals consult with them to incorporate a new facet into their game.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, as a writer I might consult with a fellow writer who has a strong ability to flash forward in
                their work. Or, another with the ability to convey multi-conversation dialogue. Ultimately - the
                classroom establishes the foundation, provides historical context, or theoretical frameworks.
                However, it is always going to bear the responsibility of said artist to hone their skills. To master
                their craft.</p>
            <strong className={css.strong}>You gotta learn and experience first before you can teach and guide others, second. Great
                people are always learning.</strong>
            <p className={css.thematicBreak}>- - -</p>
            <p>I’ve used several pseudonyms since I was a kid.</p>
            <p>I’ve been an artistic individual since childhood.</p>
            <p>I was “different” back then. I’m still different today. I wasn’t the fit-in type of person; assimilation
                makes me uncomfortable. Trying to align with the collective only made me sad. But I’m also not
                referring to being on an actual team, or group, or organization… Like, I can recognize a shared goal
                where everyone knows their role, and each person takes responsibility in achieving it. So, I’m not
                referring to being a team player; not in this context.</p>
            <p>Moreso, trying to meet the societal expectations placed upon me, led me to an early identity crisis.
                Trying to be what everyone expected me to be, and not what I wanted to be. When I was younger, I
                was socially malleable. A chameleon, wherein I could fit within any circle. I was personable as well;
                still am</p>
            <p>Additionally - I was reserved, chill, laid-back… and whatever other synonym that you can equate.
                Though I can also admit that I was nice at times. Never “too nice” though, because the second I felt
                taken advantage of, well... Eyes got wide, and not mine.</p>
            <p>The situations I once tolerated, I saw it happening. And, I observed it. I heard it, I felt it. During the
                moment, not after the fact. Fortunately, I never perceived the experiences as a threat to my character.
                Intrinsically, I was aware of who I was. I knew of my purpose and goals. The majority of the time, it
                was all entertainment for me.</p>
            <p>I tend to believe I’m a fairly likable person; or perhaps that’s my arrogance speaking… However, I
                felt I was too nice to others due to respect for my parents who raised us with manners. I felt I had
                been doing PR since I was five years old, because how I really gr… Yeah, anyways. Fortunately, I was
                forward-thinking to understand the spaces where being nice and liked by others could take me.</p>
            <p>But as I matured… I started to realize the people where I was, didn’t know where I came from. And,
                how I came to be where we were at. “Professionalism” negates it all.</p>
            <p>For some from where I’m from, they didn’t know where I was. Especially, in-relation to perhaps
                what they had seen posted by others on social. I believe it created a warped sense of reality that’s
                consistently disseminated digitally. Salary expectations and livable incomes, relationships. So many
                conversations. So many voices. Too many cooks in the virtual kitchen.</p>
            <p>The notion extends to our domiciles as well, our local communities.</p>
            <p>Interestingly - as aspiring leaders elevate in their careers, they tend to interact with the same people.
                At events, or meetings. Social gathering… Ahh, I recall several events and meetings. The caliber of
                people in attendance.</p>
            <p>However, I also recall the process and journey to engage in those spaces. The personal and
                professional sacrifice it required. The hardships to reap some of the benefits. Importantly, to pass
                that wisdom & knowledge forward to others. For me, through narrative.</p>
            <strong className={css.strong}>I was always a n’word in different spaces too. Intrinsically</strong>
            <p>Sure, I leveled up and I gained real-life “clout” through my mentorship, volunteer services, and my
                professional work. I tell folks they can either like me or not, but they cannot dispute my first 31
                years on earth.</p>
            <strong className={css.strong}>Game-recognizes-game. If you do it as you’ve done it… Then I can respect it. Pat knows
                who is who.</strong>
            <p>I quit trying to be liked by others once I realized that most people only like what they want to hear.
                Or, what they want to see. That is their personal algorithm.</p>

            <p className={css.thematicBreak}>- - -</p>

            <p>“Professional-” I’ve always said is what I do. I am enthralled by the impact of my work. Sure job
                titles and previous employer have just provided me with some respect in the workplace… I suppose</p>
            <p>However, & more importantly, I am just a curious person. That’s how I would describe myself.
                That’s how I’ve always approached my work throughout my life.</p>
            <p>I established my professional career with a creative mind. I was able to move up and do some cool
                things along the way.</p>
            <p>Should I write about other people’s lives instead?</p>
            <p>I understand it’s become trendy. But imagine establishing a career based on commenting about other
                people’s lives. Who are you?</p>
            <p>This is not to imply public figures, public actions, cannot be publicly discussed. It comes with the
                territory, I understand that.</p>
            <p>… But I don’t know, but I’ve always been cognizant of one day having my own encyclopedia page
                and the type information that would be on it. My life’s journey has been sequential thus far… I’m
                understanding that my literature is part of my story.
            </p>
            <p>I’m going to write around my experience.</p>
            <p>A good story is not a trauma dump. That doesn’t inspire anyone. It doesn’t empower anyone. It
                makes others weary, if not dejected. If bad shit occurred, well it should just be part of the story.
            </p>
            <strong className={css.strong}>People who ain’t oppressed are making themselves oppressed…</strong>
            <p>How did they overcome it though? What did they go on to achieve or accomplish despite the hardship? Otherwise,
                it’s a non-story to me. In literature, we refer to this author's credibility. What is the author trying to
                get at? What is the message? Is it to sell content and/or go viral? It is because it’s trendy and it sells?
                Is it the oppression Olympics?
            </p>
            <p>Folks are generating massive incomes profiting off people’s insecurities and lack of self-esteem.
                Building movements capitalizing off grief and pain.</p>
            <p>We don’t want to take heed or accept counsel from successful leaders and entrepreneurs who tell us
                to get directly to get our shit together. Those who can reflect upon their hardships as sources of
                motivation in achieving their goals. I am referring to real-life success. Not those 10-minute-long ads
                that play before your online content</p>

            <p className={css.thematicBreak}>- - -</p>

            <p>The minute that I began reflecting upon my journey and I began sharing the narrative with others.
                Revealing the realness of the process. The honesty. With transparency…
            </p>
            <p>That’s when people stopped “liking” what they no longer wanted to hear</p>
            <p>Truthfully - that’s just the life of the creative writer. But its why certain authors use pseudonyms.</p>
            <p>I’ve gone through the trials and tribulations of being “different” than others. But I learned to accept
                it. As, it’s often what connects people to me.
            </p>
            <p>Conversely - it can create distance from many as well. Certainly, some will be uncomfortable with my
                presence. And that’s okay, as they will be okay… I suppose.</p>
            <p>Back in the 1830s, a writer could publish an article or story inspired by their own life. And, they
                could alter names or change locations in the story and classify the work as fiction.
            </p>
            <p>Because what is fiction?</p>

            <p  className={css.thematicBreak}>- - -</p>

            <p>Fiction simply means that the events described in the work did not occur in real life. Fiction allows
                creative writers to utilize their imagination. To express their experiences, or desires, creatively</p>
            <p>Fictional stories evoke the same emotions as real-life stories. Fictional tales can make you happy, sad,
                mad, or confused depending on the plot. It doesn’t matter if the plot is set in outer space because it’s
                a love story</p>
            <p>By-the-way, there is much innuendo in fictional work. I’m just saying. (shrugs)</p>
            <p>I ponder though, “could a writer use a pseudonym writing nonfiction?”
            </p>

            <p  className={css.thematicBreak}>- - -</p>

            <h2 className={css.h2}>“STANDPAT”</h2>
            
            <p>… Man, that was a bitchin’ artistic phase, I’m not gonna lie…</p>
            <p>Ahh, yeah.
            </p>
            <p>HAHA.</p>
            <p>Yeah.
            </p>
            <p>I surely blurred the lines by using that tagline.
            </p>
            <p>I provided a “trail-of-context.”</p>
            <p>Interesting time indeed.</p>
            <p>Overall, it was worth it</p>

            <p  className={css.thematicBreak}>- - -</p>

            <p>In 2019, I shared a video to my social media titled, “Who is StandPat?” Which would set a three-year
                path that confused the shit out of many people…</p>
            <p>For me… I was very transparent regarding the inspiration for my pseudonym; StandPat. I was
                communicative about the purpose and goal of using that signifier. To StandPat…</p>
            <p>Perhaps, as you’ve read through this piece, you might have conjured that I have a greater awareness
                of myself. I have a strong comfort level with Pat. That I am content in my character, and that I don’t
                feel the need to assimilate, or to fit-in with others. That I can stand pat, to myself</p>
            <p>It means remain firm in your beliefs and your decisions. To be resolute in your choices. To always be
                considerate yet deliberate, and stand upon it. Because Pat knows fully well who he is. I have always
                stood pat regarding my work. It’s not about making people feel comfortable, or uncomfortable. It’s
                about being forward and truthful. It’s not for enjoyment, or entertainment. Who cares?</p>
            <p>However - this isn’t the 1840s anymore. I recognize my name is Patrick. Could I fully expect people
                who knew Pat as the person, to distinguish the tone within my work, as a StandPat? Even though I
                provided the context every step of the way…
            </p>
            <p>For myself, a “trail of context” implied everything is articulated and explained. Though, with this
                approach, runs the risk of the message coming back on you, especially if you overshare; so, it’s best
                to stand pat on the words, or just don’t speak.
            </p>
            <p>We are a “clips-not-context” culture. The average attention span is decreasing. Anything over 100
                words requires a summary guide. Less people are watching full videos (Over 10 minutes) or reading
                entire articles. (Over three paragraphs)
            </p>
            <p>But yet are still commenting and gossiping; formulating opinions/perspectives based on partial or
                inaccurate information. There are too many virtual lawyers and digital detectives. To hell with enrolling
                in an actual journalism course, right? However, if you have got an online following, then you can be just
                that. An “online journalist.” A blogger. Conversely, do journalists even leave the newsroom anymore? Do they
                conduct outside reporting, or accept outside reports? I don’t even know. It has been some years since I last
                worked in a newsroom…</p>
            <p>I ADMIT, I write long pieces. For me to keep readers engaged for extended periods, then my
                delivery and content as a writer needs to remain on-point. It can’t feel as if folks are reading
                4000-words, or 15+ pages.</p>
            <p>I’m sorry but actual essays are long. Any person can be profound in less than 140 characters. One
                contradiction after another. A result of not standing pat. Saying anything for likes and follows.</p>
            <p>I educated in school [wink] and earned (not, received) my degree in literature. I write with purpose;
                not to impress with my diction. I’ve written Haikus. I can write shorthand. However, I compose my
                essays in longhand. They are all handwritten.
            </p>
            <p>Imagine reading thousands of words in a book that you don’t understand or can’t comprehend.
                That’s one mistake I see with junior writers. Trying to sound like a writer in the work, instead of
                simply being one. Not prioritizing the message or the plot, by overusing multisyllabic words. If it’s a
                thesis or dissertation, it makes sense. It’s not necessary for a children’s book</p>
            <p>Unless the writer is able to do it well. Which can assist in increasing the diction of readers, through
                properly contextualizing any word, where the only challenge for the reader is the pronunciation;
                because they can still surmise its meaning. However – this takes years of experience to hone and
                develop the skill in writing.</p>
            <p>I believe when public speakers use too many complex words, they’re not perceived as trustworthy or
                honesty by the audience. *Unless they have an ability to code-switch, or that’s their target audience.
            </p>

            <p  className={css.thematicBreak}>- - -</p>

            <p>I try to create discourse that is direct yet conscious. That can affect people in their souls. I feel like a
                “soul writer.” If I channel pain, trauma, or hardship it’s to empower. But I can’t allow it to hold me
                back. Life happens and disruptions, or intermissions, are a part of the story. I quit telling secrets
                years ago… I still utilize discretion and maintain privacy. But I’m unafraid to transparently address
                the journey. Do I advise others to do the same? No, I don’t.
            </p>
            <p>Although, I don’t take solace in the distinction as an educated, or “trained writer.” However - I must
                delineate and distinguish myself from the general population. Suddenly, more people are writers.
                Who did they study under? What are their top literary devices? I don’t write for clout. This isn’t for
                views. This isn’t for money. It’s daunting for me to publish work. I am chasing the historic. A blog is
                sudden and instant. My work is classified as literature. I go through multiple edits and several
                revisions prior to releasing any work.
            </p>
            <p>Don’t compare me to social media authors. That isn’t my purpose. I’m not chasing a following.
            </p>
            <p>With my work, there are those who do not want to hear or see the content. The realness, and
                genuinely. It’s thought-provoking elegance.
            </p>
            <p>Everyone can feel the work. Many can resonate with aspects, or with the entire message. My work is
                not a brand. I am not “selling” anything. But rather, I’m giving it away for a cost. But I shared
                information at the cost of nothing, for a long time.</p>
            <strong className={css.strong}>FreeSense.</strong>
            <p>That is what “real” is; wisdom.</p>
